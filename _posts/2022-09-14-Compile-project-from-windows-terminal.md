---

### 1. Download Visual Studio Build Tools

To begin compiling your project, you need to install the **Visual Studio Build Tools**. Depending on your project needs, download the appropriate version for your system.

* Go to the official [Visual Studio downloads page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022) and click to download the **Build Tools for Visual Studio**.

### 2. Install Required Components

Once the installer is downloaded, you'll need to select the appropriate components for your project. These typically include:

* **MSVC v143 - Visual Studio 2022 C++ x64/x86**: Required for compiling C++ code.
* **Windows 11 SDK**: Essential if you're targeting Windows 11.
* **CMake (Optional)**: Useful if your project uses CMake for building.

Hereâ€™s an example of what the installation screen might look like:

### 3. Open the Developer PowerShell for VS 2022

After installation is complete, you'll need to open the **Developer PowerShell for VS 2022** to use the necessary build tools.

1. Press the **Windows key**, and search for "Developer PowerShell for VS 2022".
2. Click to open the terminal.

This terminal is pre-configured with all the environment variables needed for compiling with Visual Studio.

### 4. (Optional) Generate .sln Project Using CMake

If your project uses CMake, you'll need to generate the `.sln` (Visual Studio Solution) file before compiling.

* To generate the solution, navigate to the directory containing your `CMakeLists.txt` file in the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
cmake .
```

For more details on using CMake, refer to the [CMake Documentation](https://cmake.org/documentation/).

### 5. Compile the .sln Project

With your solution file (`.sln`) ready, you can now compile the project.

* To compile the project in **Release** mode, run:

```bash
MSBuild MyApp.sln -p:Configuration=Release
```

* For a **Debug** build, simply run:

```bash
MSBuild MyApp.sln
```

### 6. Final Step: Run the Executable

Once the compilation process completes, you'll find the executable file (e.g., `MyApp.exe`) in the output directory. This is the file you can run directly on your Windows system.
